For default installation, run

  ./configure
  mk

If you get warnings about directories not writable, but you intend to
install as root (e.g., with sudo), you can ignore the warnings.

To adjust module names and installation directories

  cp mk.config.defaults mk.config 
  emacs mk.config # edit to tast
  ./configure
  mk

Finally

  mk install

or 

  sudo mk install
