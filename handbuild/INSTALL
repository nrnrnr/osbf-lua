OSBF-Lua version 3.0 is configured partly by hand and partly
automatically, although fully automatic configuration may work on some
platforms.  It has been tested on FreeBSD, 32-bit Debian Linux, 64-bit
Red Hat Linux, Mac OSX, and Solaris running gcc.

Automatic Configuration and Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For an attempt at fully automatic installation, run

  ./configure
  make
  make install

If you intend to install as root, instead run

  ./configure --sudo
  make
  sudo make install

If the configuration fails, try the manual method below.


Manual Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Adjust module names and installation directories by making a file mk.config:

  cp mk.config.defaults mk.config 
  emacs mk.config # edit to tast

Then as above either

  ./configure
  make
  make install

or

  ./configure --sudo
  make
  sudo make install

  ./configure
  mk
