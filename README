This is a new version of the Lua code supporting OSBF-Lua.

It is designed to be used in three ways:

  1. Direct from other Lua programs, through the osbf.commands interface.
     This interface interacts only via Lua parameters and results, and
     it never uses standard input, standard output, or standard error
     (except internal errors in the code might manifest as assertion
     failures).

  2. From the command line via the osbf script.  This script calls
     functions in the osbf.command_line interface, which in turn call
     functions in osbf.  When called from the command line, the script
     will respond on standard output.

  3. As part of an email filtering chain, using the 'osbf filter' command.
     This script validates the password as needed and calls commands
     from the osbf.mail_commands interface.  It takes a message from
     stdin.  By default, when there is no command, 'osbf filter' puts
     the message in the cache, classifies it, inserts suitable header
     lines and SFIDs, and writes the altered message to standard output.
     When other commands are given, 'osbf filter' instead executes
     those commands and sends a response by return mail.

The goal is that the exact same set of commands be available through
all three interfaces.

Regardless of whether or how standard input and output are used, and
independently of how they are invoked, any command may affect the
state of the cache, the databases, whitelists, blacklists, and so
on---after all, that's the point.
