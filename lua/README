Things that are here, and the order in which to read them:

  osbf.lua          - At present, loads all submodules, and exposes an 'init' function 
                      and 'std_opts' table.
  cfg.lua           - Configuration parameters for the entire package,
                      but only those that can't be changed by the user.
  default_cfg.lua   - Configuration parameters that can be changed by
                      the user.  Each user will be encouraged to clone
                      and modify the file, then place it in $HOME/.osbf-lua.
  util.lua          - Module osbf.util.  A random collection of utility
                      functions, most unrelated to the specifics of OSBF-Lua
  lists.lua         - Code for managing whitelists and blacklists on disk.
                      Mostly self-contained.
  msg.lua           - The most important module: tabular representation of
                      a mail message, together with many reading and
                      conversion functions.
  commands.lua      - A collection of all the commands OSBF-Lua knows how
                      to do, as intended to be called by other Lua code
                      (or C code for that matter).
  learn.lua         - Extends the commands module with commands
                      specifically related to learning and unlearning (and
                      maybe classification should go here as well; not
                      sure yet).
  command_line.lua  - Ways of invoking OSBF-Lua commands from the
                      command-line script.
  osbf              - The command-line script itself.
  mail_commands.lua - Ways of invoking OSBF-Lua by sending oneself an
                      email message, which in turn should pass through
                      'osbf filter'.
  Makefile.am       - Installs the command-line script and all modules.
