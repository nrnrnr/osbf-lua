Here's what's implemented:

  ==> cache_report.lua <==       implemented as 'osbf3 cache-report'
  ==> classify.sample <==        implemented as 'osbf3 classify'
  ==> create_databases.lua <==   part of 'osbf3 init'
  ==> database_status.lua <==    implemented as 'osbf3 stats'
  ==> getopt.lua <==             part of the options modules
  ==> roc.lua <==                still relevant, but we have nothing to generate logs
  ==> spamfilter_commands.lua <= all this code has been refactored into modules
  ==> spamfilter_config.lua <==  updated and renamed default_cfg.lua
  ==> train.sample <==           implemented as 'osbf3 learn'

Here's what's partly implemented:

  ==> promailrc.sample <==       still relevant but needs updating
  ==> spamfilter.lua <==         partially implemented as 'osbf3 filter', 
                                 but the batch_train subject line is not implemented 
                                 yet

  util.log isn't implemented yet (or called)

Here's what needs to be reimplemented:

  ==> spamfilter.help <==        we need an 'osbf3 help' command that will
                                 be like 'osbf3 internals' only different.
                                 we might be able to share some code with 'internals'
                                 using __help instead of __doc.
  ==> toer.lua <==                needs a major update

Here are some new things I'd like to implement:

  ==> resize the databases
  ==> have 'osbf3 init' generate a random password
  ==> add command-line support for message numbers
  ==> guaranteed recovery for 'osbf3 filter' using pcall

Here's what seems irrelevant:

  ==> random.lua <==             not sure why this is here
