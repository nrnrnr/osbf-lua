Here are examples of useful things that can be done with the
OSBF-Lua API.

Things that are here:

  dir-train     -- trains from files assuming that $(basename $(dirname $i))
                   is the class of $i

  label-by-hand -- finds low-confidence messages, gets them
                   hand-labelled, and adds them to the right corpus
                   (infected with some of NR's mail-display code)

  low-prob      -- finds examples of underpopulated classes, which
                   can then be added to corpora
